##  Acceleration Due to Gravity

### Description

The `gravity` data frame has 81 rows and 2 columns.

The `grav` data set has 26 rows and 2 columns.

Between May 1934 and July 1935, the National Bureau of Standards in Washington
D.C. conducted a series of experiments to estimate the acceleration due to
gravity, _g_, at Washington. Each experiment produced a number of replicate
estimates of _g_ using the same methodology. Although the basic method
remained the same for all experiments, that of the reversible pendulum, there
were changes in configuration.

The `gravity` data frame contains the data from all eight experiments. The
`grav` data frame contains the data from the experiments 7 and 8. The data are
expressed as deviations from 980.000 in centimetres per second squared.

### Usage

    
    gravity

### Format

This data frame contains the following columns:

`g`

The deviation of the estimate from 980.000 centimetres per second squared.

`series`

A factor describing from which experiment the estimate was derived.

### Source

The data were obtained from

Cressie, N. (1982) Playing safe with misweighted means. _Journal of the
American Statistical Association_, **77**, 754â€“759.
