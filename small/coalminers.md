## Breathlessness and Wheeze in Coal Miners

### Description

Data from Ashford & Sowden (1970) given by Agresti (1990) on the association
between two pulmonary conditions, breathlessness and wheeze, in a large sample
of coal miners who were smokers with no radiological evidence of
pneumoconlosis, aged between 20–64 when examined. This data is frequently used
as an example of fitting models for bivariate, binary responses.

### Usage

    
    data("CoalMiners")

### Format

A 3-dimensional table of size 2 x 2 x 9 resulting from cross-tabulating
variables for 18,282 coal miners. The variables and their levels are as
follows:

No

Name

Levels

1

Breathlessness

B, NoB

2

Wheeze

W, NoW

3

Age

20-24, 25-29, 30-34, ..., 60-64

### Details

In an earlier version of this data set, the first group, aged 20-24, was
inadvertently omitted from this data table and the breathlessness variable was
called wheeze and vice versa.

### Examples

    
    data("CoalMiners")
    
    ftable(CoalMiners, row.vars = 3)
    
    ## Fourfold display, both margins equated
    fourfold(CoalMiners[,,2:9], mfcol = c(2,4))
    
    ## Fourfold display, strata equated
    fourfold(CoalMiners[,,2:9], std = "ind.max", mfcol = c(2,4))
    
    
    ## Log Odds Ratio Plot
    summary(l <- oddsratio(CoalMiners[,,2:9]))
    age <- seq(25, 60, by = 5)
    plot(l,
         xlab = "Age Group",
         main = "Breathlessness and Wheeze in Coal Miners")
    m <- lm(l ~ age + I(age^2))
    lines(fitted(m), col = "red", lwd=2)
