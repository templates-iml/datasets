##  Darwin's Plant Height Differences

### Description

The `darwin` data frame has 15 rows and 1 columns.

Charles Darwin conducted an experiment to examine the superiority of cross-
fertilized plants over self-fertilized plants. 15 pairs of plants were used.
Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized plant and one self-fertilized
plant which germinated at the same time and grew in the same pot. The plants
were measured at a fixed time after planting and the difference in heights
between the cross- and self-fertilized plants are recorded in eighths of an
inch.
