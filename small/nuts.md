## nuts

### Description

Squirrel data set (nuts) from Zuur, Hilbe, and Ieno (2013). As originally
reported by Flaherty et al (2012), researchers recorded information about
squirrel behavior and forest attributes across various plots in Scotland's
Abernathy Forest. The study focused on the following variables. response cones
number of cones stripped by red squirrels per plot predictor sntrees
standardized number of trees per plot sheight standardized mean tree height
per plot scover standardized percentage of canopy cover per plot The stripped
cone count was only taken when the mean diameter of trees was under 0.6m
(dbh).

### Usage

    data(nuts)

### Format

A data frame with 52 observations on the following 5 variables.

`cones`

total fish counted per site

`ntrees`

mean water depth per site

`dbh`

adjusted area of site

`height`

total fish counted per site

`cover`

mean water depth per site

`sntrees`

standardized mean water depth per site

`sheight`

standardized total fish counted per site

`scover`

standardized mean water depth per site

### Details

nuts is saved as a data frame. Count models use ntrees as response variable.
Counts start at 3
