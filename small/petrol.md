##  N. L. Prater's Petrol Refinery Data

### Description

The yield of a petroleum refining process with four covariates. The crude oil
appears to come from only 10 distinct samples.

These data were originally used by Prater (1956) to build an estimation
equation for the yield of the refining process of crude oil to gasoline.

### Usage

    
    petrol

### Format

The variables are as follows

`No`

crude oil sample identification label. (Factor.)

`SG`

specific gravity, degrees API. (Constant within sample.)

`VP`

vapour pressure in pounds per square inch. (Constant within sample.)

`V10`

volatility of crude; ASTM 10% point. (Constant within sample.)

`EP`

desired volatility of gasoline. (The end point. Varies within sample.)

`Y`

yield as a percentage of crude.

### Examples

    
    library(nlme)
    Petrol <- petrol
    Petrol[, 2:5] <- scale(as.matrix(Petrol[, 2:5]), scale = FALSE)
    pet3.lme <- lme(Y ~ SG + VP + V10 + EP,
                    random = ~ 1 | No, data = Petrol)
    pet3.lme <- update(pet3.lme, method = "ML")
    pet4.lme <- update(pet3.lme, fixed = Y ~ V10 + EP)
    anova(pet4.lme, pet3.lme)
